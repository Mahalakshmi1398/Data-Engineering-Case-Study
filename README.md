Certainly! Here's an example README file for the ETL project using APIs and web scraping with PostgreSQL and Pandas:

##ETL Project: APIs and Web Scraping with PostgreSQL and Pandas
This project aims to demonstrate an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process using APIs and web scraping techniques to extract data from external sources, transform it using Pandas, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. The project specifically utilizes the Utelly API, Rapid API, and Unogs API as the data sources for movies and TV shows.

Prerequisites
Before running the ETL process, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3.x
PostgreSQL database
Required Python libraries: pandas, requests, psycopg2
Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install pandas requests psycopg2
Configure the PostgreSQL database connection:

Open the config.py file in the project directory.
Update the DATABASE variable with your PostgreSQL database connection details (host, port, database name, username, and password).
Obtain API credentials:

Sign up and obtain API credentials for the Utelly API, Rapid API, and Unogs API.
Open the config.py file and update the API_KEYS variable with your API credentials.
Usage
To run the ETL process, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

The script will extract data from the Utelly API, Rapid API, and Unogs API, transform it using Pandas, and load it into the PostgreSQL database.

Monitor the console for progress updates and any potential errors.

Once the ETL process is complete, you can access the transformed data in the PostgreSQL database.

Customization
Feel free to customize and enhance the project according to your specific requirements:

Explore additional APIs or data sources and modify the extraction process accordingly.
Extend the data transformation step in the etl.py script using Pandas to apply more complex data manipulations or calculations.
Modify the PostgreSQL database schema or create additional tables to accommodate the transformed data as needed.
